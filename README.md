# Cyberdeck

This contains all the code for my cyberdeck, called the Rainbox, designed specifically for Urbex. It has custom hardware like the keyboard I make through JLCPCB. The Rainbox is completely compatible with my [civil-disobedience system](https://github.com/PAN-DA-BOI/civil-disobedience). Being able to link up the biosensors to a second recording station means more reliable data to be learned from later.


If you're building one, just hit copy on this and paste it into the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/PAN-DA-BOI/cyberdeck.git
mv cyberdeck /
cd /cyberdeck
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
